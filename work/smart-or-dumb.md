# *Would you rather be frustrated because you're the smartest person in the room, or the dumbest person in the room?*

I've always felt like I shouldn't be the smartest person in the room.
It feels great to be the one with the answer, but is there a point in existing in a place where you're never learning from other people or getting better at something? 
Do you want to be the person who is always being asked for things, or to do things?
It's fine if you're the most "senior" person, but don't let yourself get complacent.
Go talk to someone else that does something completely different and learn what they are willing to teach you.
