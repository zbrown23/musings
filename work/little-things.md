# When I say "jump", you say "how high?"
You do not want to build a team that works this way. 
The point of a team is to work with each other. Don't be this leader.

# "That's not my job"
If someone asks you to do something and this is your response, check your head.
You can at least take the time to help them find whoever's job it *is* to do that thing. 
Or just be a nice person and help them with it.

# "I'm busy, go away" versus "I'm busy, but what's up?"
Always try for #2.

# Talk to your technician, machinist, fabricator, welder, etc.
> "Hi, I am designing this thing that you're going to have to make. What can I do to make that as easy as possible for you?"

This simple question will make everyone love working with you.
