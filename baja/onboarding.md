# Baja Onboarding
* An onboarding project should be easy enough that a motivated new person with little experience in the field can do it, and it is a stimulating challenge. 
It should not be so hard that they are discouraged by information overload or a lack of clarity and give up.
* Act like no one new is going to ask you questions. 
They are likely too scared or overwhelmed by the team to do so.
* Onboarding projects should be short.
If you expect someone to spend more energy on onboarding than the car, you need to increase the scope of the car to give them something to do.
* Don't expect people to be able to do everything after their onboarding project. You're not going to teach everyone everything with one project, that's insane.
* An infodump on new members seems like a bad idea, but it's actually an excellent way to gauge interest. Watch how people react to being fed a large amount of information. Do they soak it up like a sponge or just let it wash over them? Do they ask questions? Contribute?
* People will quit during onboarding, **and that's okay.** Baja isn't for everyone.
Don't measure onboarding success by the amount of potential talent lost, measure by the amount of talent gained.
